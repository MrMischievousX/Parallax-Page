    <p id="para">
      The moon is the queen of night and a splendour among starry heavens. A
      walk in a moonlit night is really a refreshing and fascinating experience.
      Strolling in a moonlit night is pleasant and delightful in ways more than
      one. Walking in the moonlit night does not only remove the weariness and
      boredom of the hectic day but also it elevates our spirit, enlivens our
      soul and refreshes our mind. The atmosphere during a moonlit night is
      reigned by calmness and quietness if we walk through the countryside,
      which is away from humdrum, noise and clamour of cities. Moreover, the
      cool air and the cool beams of the moon, kissing each and every object of
      nature, present a charming sight. One really feels thrilled and relieved.
      One feels a sense of joy. There comes the freedom of mind, thoughts and
      ideas. A moonlit night delights our heart and soul. The tranquil
      surrounding in the countryside or distant landscapes present a lovely
      sight. The moon shines like a lighthouse to guide us in the night. And in
      such a night, away from the din and dust of cities, when we are in the
      company of our dearest friends, cutting jokes and chatting with them it is
      an alluring pleasure. The stars in the presence of the moon make it the
      guardian of all the stars. The entire nature is clothed in the shining
      silvery robes of the moonlit night. Every object appears to be cheerful
      and mirthful. The flowers emitting sweet fragrance, the petals dancing to
      the tune of soothing and cool wind and the trees whispering in the breeze
      really render a fascinating spectacle. The green fields, flowers and
      fruits dance in a coherent rhythm because of wind and moonlight. Indeed,
      moonlight is a feast for eyes. The superb sights scenes and sounds of
      nature are enhancing. To play, sing and talk would be some of the coveted
      pleasures of a moonlit night. The memories of a moonlit night are still
      fresh in my mind and still hurting my mind. A Walk in a moonlit night is a
      good experience because we come close to mother nature.
